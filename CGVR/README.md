## Without Algorithms...

- 1. Bresenham Line can be directly drawn using opengl primitive GL_LINES and 2 vertex. in case you don't get output using Bresenham Algorithm just connect two vertices.
- 2. Bresenham Circle algorithm is confusing, you can use Trignometric function to draw circle, refer cylinder_parallelepiped.cpp->drawCircle() function.
- 3. For Line clipping algorithm you can directly calculate intersection point using the forumula used in program and manually draw it.
