### Implement the following programs in C/C++ with OpenGL Libraries:

- [ ] Write a program to generate a line using Bresenham’sline drawing technique. Consider 
slopes greater than one and slopes less than one. User must able to draw as many lines and 
specify inputs through keyboard/mouse.
- [ ] Write a program to generate a circle using Bresenham’s circle drawing. User can specify 
inputs through keyboard/mouse.
- [ ] Design and develop an OpenGL application program to create two windows. Draw a 
rectangle of specified width and height by setting four different colors to its corners in the 
first window. In the second window, draw the same rectangle and spin it continuously. Use 
the double buffer concept.
- [ ] Design and develop C program using OpenGL libraries to create two windows: display 
a cylinder in one window and parallelepiped in second window.
Note: Create a cylinder and a parallelepiped by extruding a circle and quadrilateral 
respectively.
- [ ] Write a program to recursively subdivides a tetrahedron to form 3D Sierpinski gasket. 
The number of recursive steps is to be specified at execution time.
- [ ] Write a program to demonstrate the approximation of a 3D sphere with appropriate 
mathematical formulations. Write the complete C program to approximate a sphere using 
OpenGL primitives.
- [ ] Write a program to fill any given 2D polygon using Scan-line area filling algorithm.
- [ ] Write a program toimplement the Cohen Sutherland line clipping algorithm. Make 
provision to specify the input for multiple lines, window for clipping and viewport for 
displaying the clipped image.
- [ ] Write a program to implement the Liang-Barsky line clipping algorithm. Make provision 
to specify the input for multiple lines, window for clipping and viewport for displaying the 
clipped image.
- [ ] Write a program to implement theCohen-Hodgeman polygon clipping algorithm. 
Makeprovision to specify the input polygon and window for clipping.
- [ ] Write a program to create a house like figure and perform the following operations.
i. Rotate it about a given fixed point using OpenGL transformation functions.
ii. Reflect it about an axis y=mx+c using OpenGL transformation functions.
- [ ] Write a program to create a color cube and spin it using OpenGL transformations.
The output must be adjusted suitably when the window is resized or moved to a new 
position.


### Working examples on OpenMP directives, Enviornment variables and rutime libraries

-[ ] 1. a) Write an OpenMP program that computes the value of PI using Monto-Carlo Algorithm
        a) Write an MPI program that computes the value of PI using Monto-Carlo Algorithm
-[ ] 2. Write an OpenMP program that computes a simple matrix-matrix multiplication using dynamic memory allocation.
-[ ] 4. Write an OpenMP program to convert a color image to black and white image.
